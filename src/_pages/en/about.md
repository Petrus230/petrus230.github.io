I've always loved taking things apart to understand how they work. I started with Legos and Meccano sets, moved on to dismantling appliances and computers, and eventually took on cars and houses. Somewhere along the way, I discovered electronics — with its Arduinos, Raspberries and the like — and it was inevitable: I ended up programming. \\
Since then, I haven't stopped. I work in full-stack web development, from backend to frontend, and I also handle the infrastructure that makes everything run. To me, programming is about solving problems efficiently, and having a global understanding of the system and process is key. Because in the end, programming is like building with Legos: if you don’t understand the whole box, you’ll always have leftover pieces.
